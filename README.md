# Gamemode
You can manage world lists in an array of $list variables in a file.

You can set target players to op or user.

If you want to set target all users, write down 0 at line 29 variable $mode.

Or if you want to set target only users(except op), write down 1 at same place.

You need to put world's folder name and game mode number like "world" => 0. (line 27)
